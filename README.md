**TENDER and Abstractment's works at first glance are associated with the 'random walker' generative artwork displayed in Week 6. Their work makes me feel the charm of abstract digital technology, characterized by bold color combinations and complex texture overlays that inspire deep visual responses. By incorporating these elements, the visual narrative of my project can become more immersive and engaging. Randomly arranged lines and circles of different colors are used to convey complex themes and attract the audience, enhancing the overall aesthetic and emotional depth of the work.**

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

**To achieve vivid color and texture effects directly with p5.js, which involves image processing and dynamic color manipulation, it can be used to create works of art like TENDER and Abstractment styles.**

**By leveraging these capabilities, it is possible to create complex, layered visual effects that can change in real time, enhancing the immersion of the artwork.**

**This example demonstrates dynamic effects, but the same principles can be applied to still images or textures to create dynamic, interactive works of art. By tweaking the code to use still images and applying color transitions, you can achieve effects like those seen in abstract digital art.**
